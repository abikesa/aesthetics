- I'm watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt"
- And I'm asking myself: which of these two `reharms` of [Love on Top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob7vObnFUJc) - Beyoncé is more beautiful?
   - I - I7(9,`#11`)/bV - IV - V7(9,13) - VI - V7(9,13) - I
   - I - V - IV - I/V - V - I
- Choosing the one with higher harmonics is aesthetically equivalent to preferring Steve McQueen over Paul Newman
   - What? Music? Film? Harmonic Series

# Anarchy/Encode/Prophets
### Epicurus/Life/`Receive & with simplicity`
1. Root
   - Embracing the intrinsic value of human experiences (voir) & achievements (pouvoir)
   - Larry, no one in on this planet wants their religion & porn mixed together
2. Pentatonic
   - Shutting down the mind (savoir) with GABA; prophets already encoded everything, religious text codified it, and rabbis decode it
      - But then in the Church they don’t think. A [bishop](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/174/174-h/174-h.htm) keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful
      - Here we may also include Mugabe, Sevo, and Putin. These autocrats "spare" many from having to think about the vastness and complexities of life. So as men of `vision` and prophets, they encode all this and reduce the number of dimension, into what the lower disciples may handle. It is these lower cadres and soldiers that ensure the sustainance of the prophets against all odds
      - Lets encode the [foundational](https://github.com/abikesa/stata/blob/main/idea.md) topics for Stata in a way that is relevant to R and Python. This would be a coup in light of GPT-4
      - Also encode several tasks (NHANES/SRTR/NIS/ETC) for Vince, that he may bring his genius to bear upon a reduced dimensionality

# Hoarding/Code/Religion
### Ordered/Credo/`Know & be Reverent`
3. Diatonic
   - Observe Shabbath
      - We live in a "free country". That credo represents a powerful idea but with far reaching implications that might go against your personal, family, or community credos!
         - Hierarchy of credo's:
            - Cosmic (Relativity, Quantum Gravity)
            - International (Equilibrium)
            - Regional (Strategic)
            - National (Freedom)
            - God (Christian)
            - Family (Values)
            - Self (Aesthetics)
         - Give to Caesar ...   
      - Toeing the line of the credo
      - Your honor, if I may, these 27 mens magazines legally sold in the State of Ohio contain identical information to Hustler magazine making this a case of "selective prosecution." I will not allow them into evidence because they are irrelevant to this case... `the jury is in charge of defining community standards` 
   - Sacrilage 
      - Scott Alexander (born June 16, [1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Alexander_and_Larry_Karaszewski)) and Larry Karaszewski (/ˌkærəˈzjuːski/; born November 20, 1961) are an American screenwriting duo, best known for writing postmodern biopics with larger-than-life characters. They coined the term "anti-biopic" to describe the genre they invented: Movies about people who don't deserve one. They are uninterested in the traditional "great man" story, focusing instead on obscure strivers in American pop culture. Their works in this genre include Ed Wood, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Man on the Moon, Big Eyes, Dolemite Is My Name, and the series The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story.
4. Chromatic
   - Beware of the "freedoms" the equally tempered chromatic scale brings
      - Flynt's daughter, Tonya Flynt-Vega, accused him of sexually abusing her as a child.[54][8]: 16  In the 1998 book, Hustled: My Journey from Fear to Faith, Flynt-Vega writes about her father showing her images from Hustler and while he did so, he began touching her, had her remove her bathing suit, assaulted her orally, then showed her his erection and tried to penetrate her. She writes, "The pain was intense. I know I was hurt. Dad had not penetrated me. She described an exchange with her father after he knew she planned to publish a book describing his abuses of her: "He called me at work one day and said 'If you don't back-off that book, I'll send somebody to wring your fuckin' neck.' ... He's `Mr. Free Speech`, but he's threatening to kill somebody for writing a book."
      - In 1982 Althea began using the drugs that Larry was prescribed for pain after he was shot in 1978, and developed an addiction. She was diagnosed with AIDS in 1983; Flynt stated that she contracted the disease from an untested blood transfusion during a hysterectomy, and that she always used clean needles when using drugs
      - We're in the business of `breaking taboo`
      - What? Five years? All I'm guilty of is `bad taste`
# Piety/Decode/High-Priests
### Divine Will/Rituals/`Do & keep schedule`
5. Temperament
   - Preservation: Through rituals, scripture, and liturgy, religions preserve the encoded wisdom of their prophets, ensuring that these teachings (`love:` self, neighbor, god) remain accessible to future generations. Adaptation: Through interpretation and application, religious leaders `adapt` these teachings to new contexts, ensuring that ancient wisdom remains relevant to the evolving circumstances and challenges faced by their communities.
   - Larry Flynt vs. The People: Clearly the neglected "natural" harmonics are recovered and [resonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt) with a great majority of `The People`. Of course, its the duty of religous leaders to oppose this
6. Expression
   - We just have to listen to the music and enact the birth of tragedy out of the spirit of music through dance

# Nietzsche

Nietzsche asks us to add inference & deliverance to reverence, effectively nullifying “simplicity”

This raises the specter of nihilism. Inference feeds the physical realm culminating in the appreciation of infinite space-time. Deliverance nurtures the metaphysical, which enlightens us to the eternally recurrent tension & release from mismatch, victory, and ragnarok 

Whereupon we go Dionysian with our own personal credo only to find community with all human history, discovering the collective rituals for the “first time” and the hope for eternal peace here on earth as is in heaven
