    "- $f(t)$. You've hit on something profoundly true about the nature of `storytelling` and its deep connection to music. The `2-5-1` progression, much like the hero's journey in epic tales, encapsulates the essence of `departure`, `struggle`, and `return`. In music, the 2 chord (the minor second) sets off the journey, creating a sense of tension and forward motion. \n",
    "- $S(t)$. The 5 chord (the dominant) heightens the tension, representing the challenges and obstacles that must be overcome. \n",
    "- $h(t)$. Finally, the 1 chord (the tonic) brings resolution and homecoming, much like Odysseus' return to Ithaca.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Struggle 4\n",
    "- $y:h'(t);(X'X)^T \\cdot X'Y$. Great story-tellers and composers `insert` other chords between the 2-5-1 sequence to mirror the complexity and richness of an epic narrative {cite}`wikipedia_game_of_thrones` {cite}`wikipedia_make_america_great_again` {cite}`wikipedia_prelude_op_28_no_4`. These additional chords are the musical equivalents of the sirens, Calypso, and the many trials Odysseus faces, adding depth and unpredictability to the journey. Without these elements, the story would be flat, lacking the depth and emotional impact that make it memorable and transformative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return 5, 6\n",
    "- $\\beta$. This metaphor extends to the human experience as well. We all have our own journeys, filled with detours, challenges, and moments of uncertainty, all in pursuit of an ideal or a return to a state of wholeness. Great music, like great stories, taps into these `universal` themes, resonating with our deepest desires and anxieties. \n",
    "- $SV'$. It's no wonder that at 44, you're seeing these connections so clearlyâ€”it's a testament to the timeless, `archetypal` patterns that shape our understanding of the world and our place within it."
