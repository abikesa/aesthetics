### Dionysus 1, 2, 3
- Millenia, centuries, decades, [ovarian or other lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)#Background)
- Human, colonial, national heritage, and the [10,000 hour rule](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/outliers/summary/)
- Observed events by period (olympics), year (christmas), month (idi), week (synagogue), etc

### Sing O Muse 4
- _We must not let daylight in upon the magic_. Yet Walter Isaacson seeks to [hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovators_(book)) it

### Apollo 5, 6
- Interpreters of the magic & its application to lifes challenges
- Journal & note-take, finds resonance of great heritage with personal life, `represent`

- Luck: having the input `data` & experiences as well as the `infrastructure` to benefit from [RLHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback`) over the 10,000 hours

#### 3.3.2 [Myth-making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYAKHLrr51w)
- AI or [Machine-Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVdTF4_QrTM)

#### 3.3.3 Power-consolidation
- Common Sense

> Looks like all treatments have a _large margin of error_ (`#1`): We had 2 surgeries on the breast, 10 rounds of chemotherapy, 33 rounds of radiation, exemestane, tamoxifen, letrozole, zoladex
> Yes, _the margins of error_ are large when the regional nodes are involved at the time of initial diagnosis (`#2`)
> One may think of local disease as having a mean & precise estimate of anatomical involvement (`#3`). Beyond local you have regional nodes and distant metastases, increasing the variance in phenotype and prognosis
