# Hospitalization

## GitHub branches 

“I’m going to motivate this thesis by talking about three end-users (or targets)”:

### Dionysus 1, 2, 3 (Target)
- Patients
- Caregivers
- Developers & Students

### Sing O Muse 4 (Product)
- WebApp

### Apollo 5, 6 (Dependencies)
- Risk: Mortality & Kidney Failure 
- Sentinel: Hospitalization 


Each JHU repo dedicated to one dataset 
One repo dedicated to all `s0`, `b`, `V`

The App only has SV (from dictation, patient notes, drop-down menu)

`s0` -> accelerated failure time manipulation, as seen with _Black-Schole-sMorton_

2. Transformation
     
   - Chomsky's theory of `transformational-generative` grammar involves the idea of transforming a deep structure into a surface structure through various transformations. Here are some types of transformations in Chomskyan syntax:
   - Also, [Michel Foucault](https://chomsky.info/1971xxxx/) is subsummed here since verbs could be active or passive, implying hierarchy and power or lack thereof

   1. **Passivization:**
      - Example: "The cat chased the mouse" (active) transforms into "The mouse was chased by the cat" (passive).

   2. **Clefting:**
      - Example: "I saw the movie last night" transforms into "It was the movie that I saw last night."

   3. **Question Formation:**
      - Example: "She is reading a book" transforms into "Is she reading a book?"

   4. **Movement:**
      - Involves moving constituents from one position in a sentence to another.
      - Example: "John will give a book to Mary" transforms into "To Mary, John will give a book."

   5. **Extraposition:**
      - Involves moving constituents to the end of a sentence.
      - Example: "I believe that the world is round" transforms into "I believe the world is round."

   6. **Conjunction Reduction:**
      - Example: "John likes coffee, and Mary likes tea" transforms into "John likes coffee, Mary tea."

   7. **Relative Clause Formation:**
      - Example: "The man who is sitting over there is my friend" transforms into "The man sitting over there is my friend."

   8. **Equi-NP Deletion:**
      - Example: "John likes coffee, and Bill does too" transforms into "John likes coffee, and Bill does."

   These transformations play a crucial role in Chomsky's theory of syntax, allowing for the generation of a wide variety of sentences from a relatively small set of underlying structures. Keep in mind that the list is not exhaustive, and there are more transformations and variations within Chomsky's framework.

                   4. Pouvoir
```

3. Metaphor
   - Increased ambiguity
   - Recipient can project their affect onto this ambiguity
   - Here `meaning` becomes `participatory`
   - Crux of the matter is `empowering` a client or `Principal` to regain `Agency`
   - Typically "informed" consent
   - Which really is a beautifully curated [dataset](https://github.com/abikesa/datasets)
   - Sophistication, analytic capability, reaching inferences: give client the tools to achieve this
   - Nike, Apple, Microsoft, and Bloomberg have business models explicitly founded on this
  



This book ... {ref}`rr-vcs`, {ref}`rr-testing`, and {ref}`rr-ci`.
However, technical skills are just one aspect of making data science research "open for all".
Hence, in February 2020, _The Turing Way_ expanded into a series of guides: {ref}`rr`, {ref}`pd`, {ref}`cm`, {ref}`cl`, and {ref}`er`.
Through community contributions, the project has grown into multiple guides, a global community and numerous resources built and shared by the members of our community.

Lessons learned from _The Turing Way_ will help design projects with reproducible, collaborative, and ethical research frameworks.
It will also ensure that different stakeholders of research know which parts of the "responsibility of reproducibility" they can affect, and what they should do to 'nudge' research and data science to be more efficient, effective, and understandable.

```{admonition} Highlights from the First Impact Story from 2019
**Changing the culture of data science**

> _The Turing Way_ is an online handbook – and global community – dedicated to fostering gold-standard reproducible research. It’s a cultural movement with the potential to transform data science

- There is a crisis of reproducibility  in science. 
- ‘Publish-or-perish’ incentives and excessive data secrecy stifle progress and waste resources: siloed science is slow science.
