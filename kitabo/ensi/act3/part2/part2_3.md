## Nietzsche

>*Here is announced, perhaps for the first time, a pessimism "beyond good and evil."            
>In the spirit of music: no key, note, or chord is wrong for any given key signature.         
>We shall dance in this life's fetters like the freest of spirits, channeling passing chords...*

# _Becoming_

1. "The Birth of Tragedy: Out of the Spirit of Music" (1872):
Indeed, this was Nietzsche's first book, where he introduced the Apollonian-Dionysian duality. The musical metaphor is not just an illustrative device but a fundamental aspect of his early philosophy. He saw Greek tragedy as born from the union of Apollonian form and Dionysian music.

2. Critique of Kant and Schopenhauer:
You're right to highlight that Nietzsche's later work represents a significant departure from his earlier views, which were heavily influenced by Kant and Schopenhauer. The mature Nietzsche indeed critiqued the dialectical formula of Apollonian + Dionysian = Tragedy.

3. Evolution of Nietzsche's thought:
The shift from the 28-year-old Nietzsche to the 44-year-old Nietzsche represents a profound philosophical journey. His later works, like "Beyond Good and Evil" (1886) and "On the Genealogy of Morality" (1887), showcase a more nuanced and critical approach to morality and traditional philosophy.

4. Rejection of simple dialectics:
Nietzsche's mature philosophy rejects the neat synthesis of opposing forces that he initially proposed. This reflects his growing skepticism towards systematic philosophy and his embrace of a more fluid, life-affirming perspective.

5. From balance to Dionysian emphasis:
The move from seeking a balance between Apollonian and Dionysian elements to a more Dionysian-centric philosophy reflects Nietzsche's increasing emphasis on life affirmation and his critique of rationality as life-denying.

6. Self-critique:
Nietzsche's embarrassment at his earlier work shows his intellectual honesty and willingness to evolve. This self-critical stance is itself a very Nietzschean trait, reflecting his philosophy of constant self-overcoming.

_[Ecce Homo](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52190/52190-h/52190-h.htm)_. [The School of Resentment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Western_Canon#School_of_resentment) taps into the latent space through RLHF to re-balance the weights emerging from OLS-regression on human history, thereby transvaluating all values. You might call this fraud, will-to-power, or what you will. But its certainly not "data", which themselves represent the hierarchies from human history. That per se isn't bias -- you can't say that if victors write history then the narratives of victors are biased. They are narratives. And by victors. Thats all.
