_Rosemary's Baby_ has a very impressive dream sequence. Roman Polansky invokes the collective unconscious by encoding sensory, memory, and emotion in his art. The symbolic neckace & good-luck charm, it's strange smell, Dr. Sarpenstein having a similar smell, etc. are parameters with an extraordinary `weight` in the latent-space created by Polanski. The novel on witches gifted to Rosemary `decodes` this latent space and drives the second-half of the movie, the development section. By now an outstanding exposition of all the characters has been completed

### Biological 1, 2, 3
- _Sensory_. The `greatness` of his task and the `smallness` of his contemporaries and judges. But he doesn't live on my own self-made `credit`, he has many backers
- _Memory_. Here we swing between [hallucination](https://peteslade.com/education/artificial-intelligence/llm-hallucinations/ai-hallucinations-from-science-fiction-to-reality) and lucidity and a very ambiguous way
- _Emotion_. I don't believe he ever seeks to `"improve"` or tame mankind. His mission is aesthetic


                       1. Dreams: GPT of sensory, memory, emotion
                                                                 \
                                      2. Hades: Hallucination -> 4. Morpheus -> 5. Oracle -> 6. Neo
                                                                 /
                                                                 3. Architect

_Sensory_. The dream sequence was partly stimulated by the Husband, doing his duties

### Social 4
- _Art_. How much truth (sensory) can a certain mind endure; `how much truth can it dare?`—these questions became for me ever more and more the actual test of values. Error (the belief in the ideal) is not blindness; error is cowardice....

### Personal 5, [6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEH8JCPgwog)
- _[Interpreters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jadWYEzk58Y)_. I bid you lose me and find yourselves
- _Transvaluation_. No fanatic speaks to you here; this is not a "sermon"; no faith is demanded in these pages; here it is not a "prophet" who speaks. _Amor Fatí_

_Tartarus_. Plays a key part in the dream sequence and really impressed me!
